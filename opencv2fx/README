What is it?
-----------
These are two plugins which are wrappers around the openCV functions
"cvInpaint"
and
"cvPyrSegmentation"
which add this functionality to Sony Vegas 10.
The wrapper has been written by Bernd Porr, 
http://www.berndporr.me.uk, berndporr@f2s.com.

How to install?
---------------
You can install the binary files by copying them into the Vegas openFX
plugin folder:
copy *.ofx "c:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas Pro 10.0\OFX Video Plug-Ins\Filters.ofx.bundle\Contents\Win32"
You also need to install openCV 2.1 which is available from Sourceforge.

How to compile?
---------------
You need to have the gcc and make installed on your system. The easiest way is to install MinGW.
You also need to download the openFX header files from Sourceforge. Modify the Makefile
in case the openFX header files reside in another subdirectory.
